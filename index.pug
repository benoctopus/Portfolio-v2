                  p With a short lifetime's worth of experience in tinkering, I am no stranger in the world of technology.

                  p From the core electronic components, to the vast networks that connect the globe, I am inspired as well as fascinated by the technological heights that we as a global population have reached through our primal need to build upon what already works. This fascination of mine thus drives me to fulfill my self-declared purpose, to become one cog in the machine that works toward further advancement of technology itself.

                  p As for the skills I have developed in chasing this dream, I have a wide breadth of experience in developing web and desktop applications in a variety of programming languages including javaScript, html, css, Python/Django, Ruby/Rails, and Java. I also have a bit of experience developing software for IoT devices such as the Arduino and RaspberryPi units.
